* PLANS
  
** TODO Build a working web server.

   - Framework :: Play Framework (Java/Scala)
   - Function :: Serve a REST service and a web interface

** TODO A HTTP client which can make request.

** TODO A HTTP response parser which extract key infos.
   
** TODO Make parser and client work together recursively.

** TODO Define Business layer
*** Step 1, After all urls should be crawled, First we should find data structures for WebHost, HostRelation, it allows us to find a host with linear complexity.
Second, we take these relations and find the root of these relation hosts if we could do so, we need just analyse all content of the root host.
if we can't find root, we must find a solution or define a methodology to cluster hosts to analyse.

*** Step 2, We crawl script to analyse deeper in network
*** TODO More details for next step
